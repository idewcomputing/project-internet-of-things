# 1.8 Interaction Storyboard

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Create an [interaction storyboard](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/interaction-storyboards) with a sequence of 3-6 sketched screen mockups to show how a user would interact with your smart device’s web app to perform a task.

{% hint style="info" %}
**REMINDER:** As you decide what tasks your web app could perform, remember there are 3 ways your web app can interact with your smart device through [Particle Cloud](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/particle-cloud):

* web app can read and display data from smart device
* web app can send command \(with optional data\) to smart device
* web app can receive notifications from smart device
{% endhint %}
