# 3.3 Project Poster

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will create a poster that helps show how your team researched, designed, prototyped, and evaluated your smart device solution for your targeted problem.

The poster will be a visual reference to supplement the explanation and demonstration that your team gives during the public presentation event. The goal is for the poster to be clear, concise, engaging, and professional in terms of its content and visual design.

Even though a poster cannot show and explain everything about your team's project, a person should be able to understand your team's project just by reviewing your poster.

The standard size for a large poster is 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall. \(Your teacher will clarify whether a different poster size will be used.\) Your teacher will assist with having the posters printed prior to the public presentation.
