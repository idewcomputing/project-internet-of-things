## What is the Internet of Things?

A growing trend in computing is the “**Internet of Things**” \(abbreviated as: **IoT**\) – devices connected to the internet \(and/or to other devices\) which interact with the physical world by gathering, processing, and sharing data. IoT devices are also referred to as **connected devices** or as **smart devices**.

## Examples of IoT Devices

Many different types of IoT devices are becoming available for consumers, businesses, industry, agriculture, healthcare, and the public sector. A few examples include:

* Wearable devices that monitor people’s health and fitness
* Smart thermostats that keep homes comfortable while also saving energy
* Smart street lights that adjust based on time of day, season, and weather conditions
* Smart farming systems that monitor precise weather, soil, and crop conditions
* etc.

## Characteristics of IoT Devices

IoT devices typically have one or more **physical inputs** \(such as sensors, etc.\) that gather data from the physical environment.

IoT devices typically have one or more **physical outputs** \(such as motors, etc.\) that can do something in the physical environment.

IoT devices send and/or receive data by communicating with apps, databases, or other devices through an **internet or network connection** \(which is often a wireless signal such as cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.\). This data can act as a digital input or output for IoT devices.

IoT devices are designed and programmed to automate certain tasks by **processing data** from their inputs and **responding automatically** to certain conditions by acting through their outputs.

## What made IoT possible?

The “Internet of Things” is the result of advances in technology and manufacturing that have made it feasible to incorporate computing and networking technology into almost any device:

1. **Computing parts** \(such as processors, sensors, batteries, etc.\) have become much smaller, more powerful, more energy-efficient, and more affordable.
2. **Wireless networking** \(such as cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.\) has become much faster, more energy-efficient, and more widespread.
