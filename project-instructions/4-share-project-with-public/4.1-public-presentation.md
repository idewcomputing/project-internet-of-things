# 4.1 Public Presentation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will **explain and demonstrate your project solution to a public audience**. The audience might include professionals from industry, college, and your school. Some audience members might be acting as judges reviewing the projects. Some audience members may be learning about the project for the first time.

Your team's presentation needs to tell a complete story in just a few minutes. The presentation should be clear, concise, engaging, and professional. As much as possible, let audience members have an opportunity to examine and interact with your project solution.

* Plan and practice your team’s presentation and demonstration
* Be sure to utilize your poster and product website as visual references
* Be prepared to answer questions from the audience
* Be prepared to adapt if a technical issue occurs during the demonstration
