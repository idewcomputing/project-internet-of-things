| The code tutorial was only partly completed and/or the evidence of student understanding is limited. | The core functions of the technology and code are understood, and modifications were implemented to customize the result. | The code and technology were thoroughly investigated, and creative methods were used to test the capabilities of the supplied code template. Evidence of additional learning beyond the assigned tutorial was demonstrated. |
