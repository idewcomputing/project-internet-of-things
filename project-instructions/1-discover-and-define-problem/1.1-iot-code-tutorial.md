| The code tutorials were only partly completed and/or the evidence of student understanding is limited. | All the code tutorials were completed, and the core functions of the technology and code are understood. Modifications were implemented to experiment with and customize the results. | The code and technology were thoroughly investigated, and creative methods were used to test the capabilities of the supplied code template. Evidence of additional learning beyond the assigned tutorials was demonstrated. |
