# 1.1 IoT Product Research

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Conduct internet research to find an example IoT product or system for each of these contexts:

1. **Consumer Context:** home or personal use
2. **Business Context:** business, industry, agriculture, etc.
3. **Public Context:** government services, public infrastructure, healthcare, environment, etc.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**EXCLUDED:** You CANNOT research the following consumer products: smartphones, tablets, computers, headphones, stereo systems, TVs, Blu-Ray/DVD players, streaming players, or gaming consoles.
{% endhint %}

Gather information to summarize the following for each IoT product:

* What is the IoT product’s **name**, **purpose,** and **specific context of use**? \(include product image\)
* What **value** does the IoT product provide? \(e.g., is it more convenient, is it more efficient, is it more cost-effective, is it safer, does it perform a task not possible otherwise, etc.\)
* What **physical inputs** \(such as: sensors, etc.\) does the IoT product have? What data does it gather from its physical environment using these inputs?
* What **physical outputs** \(such as: motors, etc.\) does the IoT product have? What actions does it perform in its physical environment using these outputs?
* What type of **internet or network connection** \(such as: cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.\) does the IoT product have? What data does it send or receive with apps, databases, or other devices through this connection?
* What **information sources** were used in your research? \(include links to sources\)
