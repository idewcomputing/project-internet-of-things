# 3 Evaluate & Refine Solution

![](../../.gitbook/assets/phase-3-process.png)

Evaluate the quality and value of your solution through stakeholder testing and feedback. Analyze the evaluation data to determine how well the solution met the design goals and to identify issues that may require further improvements. As time and resources allow, implement feasible improvements.

This phase of the project will require about 2-3 weeks to complete. Your teacher will identify the specific deadline\(s\) for the task assignments.
