{% tab title="✓ DELIVERABLES" %}
Each stage of the project has a set of team deliverables, but they lead to these final deliverables from each team:

* **Smart Device** built and programmed to be a functional prototype of your solution design
* **Web App** that interacts with smart device by sending and/or receiving data through internet
* **Product Website** that explains your solution and includes a product demo video
* **Project Poster** that shows how your solution was created and highlights key features
* **Public Presentation** that demonstrates your solution and explains how it was created
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="★ CRITERIA" %}
Each team's smart device prototype must meet these design criteria:

* **Innovative:** your solution should be unique \(or be an improvement over existing solutions\)
* **Feasible:** your solution should be possible to prototype with the given resources
* **Useful:** your solution should fulfill a need, solve a problem, or improve an existing situation
* **Usable:** your solution should be easy to understand and efficient to use
* **Valuable:** your solution should be desirable and valuable to users/stakeholders
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="▲ CONSTRAINTS" %}
Each team's smart device prototype is subject to these constraints:

* Smart device prototype built using sensors and other parts in provided IoT electronics kit​
* Smart device prototype can include constructed parts \(e.g., cardboard, 3D-printed, etc.\)
* Smart device prototype may have to be a smaller-scale model of actual product
* Smart device prototype may have to simulate certain parts or actions \(e.g., smart thermostat could control red and blue LEDs that represent heating and cooling systems\)
