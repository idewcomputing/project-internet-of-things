# 2.5  Smart Device and Apps

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team needs to **build and program a functional prototype of your smart device** using the provided IoT electronics kit. You'll need to code the device app that controls the smart device, as well as the web app that interacts with the smart device.

* Build the smart device using the Photon kit
* Code the Photon device app that controls the smart device
* Code the web app that interacts with the smart device
* Verify the smart device and its apps work together correctly

{% hint style="success" %}
**RESOURCE:**  The [IoT Code Guidebook](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/) contains references and links to help you with all the tasks to build and program your smart device and its apps.
{% endhint %}

### Build Smart Device

Your team must build a **functional** prototype of your smart device that can be demonstrated to the public. If necessary, you can simulate certain parts or actions as long as the main task of your smart device can still be demonstrated.

The project challenge requires that you use **at least one** [**physical input**](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-inputs) \(sensor, button, etc.\) and **at least one** [**physical output**](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-outputs) \(motor, LED light, etc.\) from the provided IoT electronics kit.

If desired, you can also construct certain parts using cardboard, 3D-printing, etc. The constructed parts could provide _functional value_ by helping the device perform its task and/or _aesthetic value_ by adding to the device's appearance for demonstration purposes.

### Code Device App

Your team will use the [Particle Build](https://build.particle.io/) online code editor to create the Photon device app that controls your smart device. You'll "flash" \(download\) the app to your smart device over Wi-Fi.

The IoT Code Guidebook has a reference explaining the different parts of a [Photon device app](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/device-app).

The IoT Code Guidebook has references explaining how to write code in your device app to:

* Control your device's [physical inputs](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-inputs) and [physical outputs](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-outputs)
* Interact with your device's web app through [Particle Cloud](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/particle-cloud)

### Code Web App

Your team will create a web app that interacts with your Photon device through Particle Cloud. The web app will consist of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file.

The IoT Code Guidebook has a reference with starter code for your [web app](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/web-app) files.

The IoT Code Guidebook also has a reference explaining how to write code in your web app JS file to interact with your smart device through [Particle Cloud](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/particle-cloud).

### Verify Device and Apps Work Together

During coding, be sure to test each new feature that you add to your device app or web app. Make sure the new feature works correctly, and be sure the previous features still work.

Once you have both apps coded, test your smart device and its apps to verify whether they work together correctly. Troubleshoot and fix any bugs or issues that you discover.

When your smart device solution is ready, your team will create a [product demo video](2.7-product-video.md) showing how your smart device prototype and its web app work together.

### **❏ Deliverable**s

* Submit a photo of your completed smart device
* Download and submit your Photon device app file \(`.ino`\)
* Submit your web app files \(`.html`, `.css`, `.js`\) – or a link to the web app files
