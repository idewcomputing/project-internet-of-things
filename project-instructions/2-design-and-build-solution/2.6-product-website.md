# 2.6 Product Website

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Most entrepeneurs or companies create a website to help promote and market new products. Sometimes this is done as a webpage on a crowdfunding website \(such as [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/), [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/), etc.\). Other times, this is done as a webpage or mini-site on a company website.

Your team will create a one-page product marketing website for your smart device solution, which will include a [product demo video](2.7-product-video.md) that your team will also create. This website will be made **public** to allow more people to learn about your smart device project.

1. Create and/or gather the content \(text, images, video, etc.\) for your team’s product marketing website. Be sure the content is clear, concise, engaging, and professional. Your website should include the following content:
   * Product Name
   * Value Proposition \(or shorten into a tagline phrase\)
   * Demo Video \(demonstrate how smart device solution works\)
   * Functions and Features \(list tasks that smart device solution can perform\)
   * Tech Specs \(list device's inputs, outputs, etc.\)
   * Image\(s\) of smart device prototype
   * Screenshot\(s\) of functional web app
2. Create a visual design for your team's one-page website that will be engaging, professional, and reinforce your product concept.
   * Generate and sketch possible ideas for the layout of the content on the webpage.
   * Determine the final website layout and overall style \(such as: colors, fonts, etc.\)
3. Use your content \(text, images, etc.\) and layout mockup to build the website using a tool such as [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/create?usp=drive_web) \(available within Google Drive, see [Get Started with Sites](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/sites/get-started/) guide\) – or code the website using HTML and CSS.
   * Include temporary placeholders for the product demo video and product images \(smart device & web app\) until they are ready to add to the website.

In the next phase of the project, you'll test the website with people outside your team to make sure the website is effective at explaining and marketing your team's solution. 

### **❏ Deliverable**

Submit a link to your team's product marketing website for its smart device solution.
