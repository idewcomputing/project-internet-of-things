{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Create a slide presentation that explains your team’s proposal for a smart device and web app. Practice your presentation before delivering it to your class. This will be an opportunity for other project teams to ask questions and provide constructive feedback to help your team clarify and improve its project concept.

Your team's presentation should briefly summarize \(in this order\):

1. **Project Team:** product name, team name, team members & their roles
2. **Value Proposition:** be sure your value proposition is clear and compelling
3. **Competitive Analysis:** Briefly describe your examples of competing products & highlight their key strengths and weaknesses. Explain the opportunities your team identified to design a product that is unique or better compared to the competitors.
4. **User Research:** Identify how many people were interviewed and how they were selected. Highlight key aspects of the persona that was created from the interview data, and describe the scenario for the persona.
5. **Design Requirements:** Highlight key requirements for the smart device and web app, and briefly explain how these were influenced by your competitive analysis and user research.
6. **Interaction Storyboard:** Identify the selected task, and briefly explain how a user interacts with the web app to complete the task \(and how the web app interacts with the smart device through the internet\).
