# Project Challenge and Background



{% hint style="danger" %}
**UPDATE IN PROGRESS:** This project guidebook is undergoing a major update to replace the [old version](https://docs.idew.org/internet-of-things-project/). Please check back later.  _Notice posted: June 5, 2018_
{% endhint %}

### Project Deliverables

* **Smart Device with Photon app** that is a functional prototype of your solution design
* **Web App** that interacts with smart device by sending and/or receiving data through Internet
* **Product Website** that explains the solution and includes a product demo video
* **Project Poster** that shows how the solution was created and highlights key features of its design
* **Public Presentation** that demonstrates the solution and explains how it was created

### Project Criteria

* **Innovative:** solution should be unique \(or be an improvement over existing solutions\)
* **Feasible:** solution should be possible to prototype with given resources
* **Useful:** solution should fulfill a need, solve a problem, or improve an existing situation
* **Usable:** solution should be easy to understand and efficient to use
* **Valuable:** solution should be desirable and valuable to users/stakeholders

### Project Constraints

* Smart device built using parts from SparkFun Photon electronics kitâ€‹
* Smart device Photon app coded using Wiring programming language \(similar to Arduino\)
* Smart device web app coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript \(including ParticleJS library\)
* Smart device prototype may have to be a smaller-scale model of actual product
* Smart device prototype may have to simulate certain parts or actions
